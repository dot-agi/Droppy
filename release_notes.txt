# Droppy v2.7.2: The "Liquid" Update Experience ✨

*This release introduces a stunning new update screen and solidifies v2.7.x stability.*

This release marks a major milestone for Droppy, ensuring that even the update process feels like a premium, fluid experience.

### ✨ New Update Experience
- **Liquid Glass UI**: The update screen is no longer a boring system alert. It is now a beautiful, translucent window that follows the macOS 26 design language.
- **Rich Release Notes**: Release notes now support **bold**, *italics*, and lists, making it easier to see what's new.
- **Scrollable Content**: No more truncated text! You can now scroll through the full history of changes.

### 📋 Liquid Clipboard Manager
- **Direct Content Editing**: Edit text and URLs directly in the history. The UI morphs seamlessly into a dedicated editor.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Copying an existing item now intelligently moves it to the top without creating duplicates.
- **Persistent Metadata**: Your "Favorites" and "Renamed Titles" are preserved even if you copy the item again.
- **Visual History**: Rich previews for text, images, files, and colors.
- **Fluid Animations**: "Marching ants" animations for search, rename, and editing modes indicate active states clearly.
- **Drag & Drop**: Seamlessly drag items from history directly to the Shelf, Basket, or other apps.

### 🛡️ Core Stability & Performance
- **Crash Fixed**: Resolved a critical crash (`objc_release`) affecting the Notch Window by separating high-frequency interaction logic (50ms) from heavy environment checks.
- **Animation Fixes**: Eliminated `CoreAnimation` transaction crashes during fullscreen transitions.
- **Optimization**: Reduced CPU and Memory usage by 20x for background visibility checks.

### 🧺 Basket & Shelf
- **Refined**: Improved click-through behavior and "Jiggle" detection accuracy.

Update now for the smoothest, most stable Droppy experience yet! 🚀
