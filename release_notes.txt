# Release Notes v3.2.7

### 🚀 Major Improvements to URL Handling
- **Rich Interactive URL Previews**: Link previews are now fully interactive. Click any preview card to open the link in your default browser.
- **Auto-Close Clipboard**: For a smoother workflow, the clipboard window now automatically closes after you click a link, letting you focus on your browsing.
- **Enhanced Preview Metadata**: URL previews now include website snapshots with titles, descriptions, and favicons, providing more context at a glance.
- **Improved Link Detection**: Smarter plain-text link detection using `NSDataDetector`, allowing Droppy to recognize URLs even when they lack `http://` or `www.`.
- **Expanded Media Support**: Direct image previews now support `.avif` and `.apng` formats, with improved detection for common image hosting sites.

### 🍱 Refined Workspace & UI
- **20% Wider Clipboard Window**: Increased the maximum width of the clipboard window from 864px to **1040px**. This provides a more spacious layout for rich content and ensures the preview pane feels premium and uncrowded.
- **Matched Action Badges**: The "Website" and "Image Link" badges have been restyled to exactly match the "Extract Text" button's aesthetic, including its ultra-thin material background, refined overlay, and subtle shadow.
- **Title Case Badges**: Updated badge labels to a cleaner Title Case for a more modern, integrated appearance.
- **Borderless Aesthetic**: Removed borders and internal backgrounds from URL previews for a cleaner, glass-like look that blends perfectly with Droppy's design language.

### 🧹 Code Health & DX
- Fixed various compiler warnings related to unused values and results.
- Optimized MainActor synchronization for smoother UI transitions.
- Improved coordinate conversion logic in multi-monitor setups.
